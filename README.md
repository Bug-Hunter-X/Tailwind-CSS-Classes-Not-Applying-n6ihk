# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applying Bug Report

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS: classes not applying correctly or unexpected behavior. The bug involves hover effects and other utility classes not rendering as intended.

## Description

The bug showcases a scenario where Tailwind classes, specifically hover effects and potentially other utilities, are not applied as expected. The `hover:bg-blue-700` class, for example, should change the background color on hover but might not function correctly.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.js` (or equivalent file based on your framework) containing the buggy code.
3. Run the application.
4. Observe that the Tailwind classes exhibit unexpected behavior.

## Solution

The solution can involve various approaches, including:

* **Checking for CSS Conflicts:** Ensure that there aren't any conflicting CSS rules overriding Tailwind's styles.
* **Correct PurgeCSS Configuration:** If using PurgeCSS, verify the configuration to ensure that the necessary classes are not purged.
* **Build Process:** Make sure Tailwind's build process is correctly configured and runs successfully.
* **Typographical Errors:** Double-check for typos in class names.
* **Correct Class Structure:** Verify correct HTML structure and nesting, especially if using responsive modifiers like `sm:`, `md:`, etc.
* **Inspecting with Developer Tools:** Use the browser's developer tools to inspect the element's styles and check for any overridden styles or missing classes.
